                optics received L-shaped DRLs, the branded elements of the false

                the main reasons for the emergence of such an ambiguous design
                of the “four” was not only an appeal to the historical heritage
                of the brand (despite the absence of the “classic” Hofmeister

                generation looked rather feigned.

                generation 2 Series Coupe distanced itself from the first
                generation of the model primarily due to its external design and
                dimensions. The more compact F22, with four-section headlights
                and a grille with vertical bars traditional for the latest BMW
                models, has given way to a significantly larger G42 with
                two-section head optics (which brand representatives consider a
                reference to the 02 Series) and a grille with external
                adjustable curtains for engine cooling.

          <h1>A Brief History of the BMW Brand</h1>
          <p>
            Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, abbreviated as BMW, is a German
            multinational manufacturer of luxury vehicles and motorcycles
            headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, Germany. The company was founded
            in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines, which it produced
            from 1917 to 1918 and again from 1933 to 1945. Automobiles are
            marketed under the brands BMW, Mini, and Rolls-Royce, and
            motorcycles are marketed under the brand BMW Motorrad. In 2017, BMW
            was the world's fourteenth-largest producer of motor vehicles, with
            2,279,503 vehicles produced. The company has a significant
            motorsport history, especially in touring cars, sports cars, and the
            Isle of Man TT. BMW is headquartered in Munich and produces motor
            vehicles in Germany, Brazil, China, India, the Netherlands, South
            Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The Quandt family
            is a long-term shareholder of the company, following investments by
            the brothers Herbert and Harald Quandt in 1959 that saved BMW from
            bankruptcy, with the remaining shares owned by the public.

                generational change, the BMW X1 crossover, becoming another
                model of the U-series, changing the internal index F48 to U11.
                With this, the team of designers tried to save the brand image
                and familiarity of the front model, having simultaneously
                applied to the crossover all the necessary images of modern
                BMWs: more “lower” and “icla” in the front bumper, recessed door
                handles and characteristic design and optics.

                place on June 9, 2021. The modernization of the X3 crossover
                took place according to the “standard” program: the appearance
                and design of the front panel in the cabin were corrected, the
                integration of hybrid systems into a number of engines, the

                looked identical to the X3, if not for the branded grille, which
                has a mesh pattern on the coupe-shaped crossover. And already
                the profile of the car with a sloping roof, which is 45 mm lower

                SUV class "K3" with all-wheel drive. The third generation under
                the G06 index debuted in July 2019. The third generation of the
                BMW X6 model slightly increased in size: length - plus 26 mm
                (4935), width - plus 15 mm (2004), wheelbase - plus 42 mm
                (2975), but the height of the crossover, on the contrary, became
                lower - 1696 against 1702 mm before.

                Povnoprividny SUV class "K3". Restyling of the model with index
                G07. Crossover of performances in the spring of 2022. The
                planned renovation brought X7 some radical changes. So, for
                example, the crossover, having become the first BMW model, took
                off the double-tier head optics. It won't be long before you
                show up at the new "Sіmtsі", and there on all new models of the
                brand. Ale spinning to Іks7. We have repainted the frontal part,
                the crossover has removed the other “stuffing” of the rear
                lights, and the chrome-plated bar is now enclosed in a hole in
                the cursing body. As an option for the crossover, 23-inch wheels
                were previously ordered (previously the maximum size was 22
                inches).
